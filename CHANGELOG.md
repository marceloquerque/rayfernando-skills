# Changelog

All notable changes to this collection are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Computer Use playbook** (`references/computer-use-playbook.md`). The skill
  now discovers whether **Codex Computer Use** is available (macOS only) and,
  when it is, drives web apps and **native macOS apps** by seeing, clicking,
  and typing — the highest-fidelity way to test the real, signed-in app, and
  the only way this skill can reach a desktop Mac app. It degrades gracefully:
  most VMs (Cursor cloud, CI) lack it, so a pass still succeeds with a browser
  driver alone, and iOS app QA still defers to the iOS simulator playbook.
- **Chrome DevTools for agents (`chrome-devtools-mcp`)** added as a first-class
  rung in the browser playbook, with a new "drive like a human (don't trip the
  tests)" section: attach to your real, already-signed-in Chrome via
  `--autoConnect` / `--browser-url` so auth flows don't get bot-flagged, and
  lean on its built-in auto-wait to remove stale-ref / timing failures.
- **Native macOS app** surface detection wired through `SKILL.md` (surfaces
  table, mode picker, project-type discovery, and the browser-tools ladder).

### Changed

- **Web QA now covers mobile, tablet, and desktop.** The skill no longer
  defaults to a single mobile viewport. It tests all three device modes
  (reference sizes 375×812 / 768×1024 / 1280×800) and leads with the
  product spec's primary target; when the spec is unclear it asks the user,
  and when the user isn't available it infers the primary from the repo and
  notes the assumption — persisted in `qa-config.json#platforms.web`
  (`deviceModes` / `primary` / `primarySource`). Updated across `SKILL.md`,
  the browser playbook,
  discovery, session hygiene, the test-plan / run-report / shard / sequential
  templates, and the bug template.
- **README rewritten for humans first.** It now leads with what you get,
  screenshots of the HTML report (the prioritized bug list and a single bug
  report), and copy-paste example prompts, then links into the deeper sections
  for people and agents auditing the skill. The stacked "What's new in vX"
  blocks at the top are replaced by a short Changelog pointer near the bottom.
- **Corrected the README repo-structure tree** to match the repository — it had
  drifted several references and scripts out of date.
- Trimmed duplicate rows from the `SKILL.md` anti-patterns table so each
  remaining entry explains a distinct *why* instead of repeating the
  Always / Never lists.

### Notes

- The HTML report design is unchanged in this release, so its
  `<!-- skill:running-bug-review-board v0.3 -->` version marker stays put.
- Credits: the Chrome DevTools team for `chrome-devtools-mcp`, and OpenAI for
  Codex Computer Use.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- **Codex skill loading compatibility.** Shortened the
  `running-bug-review-board` `SKILL.md` frontmatter description from
  more than 1,600 characters to concise routing metadata under Codex's
  1,024-character hard limit. The detailed trigger language, tracker
  notes, iOS companion-skill context, and Interactive BRB guidance stay
  in the skill body and references where Codex can load them through
  progressive disclosure.

### Changed

- Shortened plugin and marketplace descriptions so Codex app, desktop,
  IDE, and CLI surfaces receive compact metadata instead of changelog-
  length summaries.

### Added

- Added `scripts/validate-skill-metadata.py`, a dependency-free release
  validator for `SKILL.md` frontmatter and plugin marketplace
  descriptions. The release workflow now runs it before building the
  skill zip so future releases cannot ship Codex-invalid descriptions.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-27

### Changed

- **HTML report redesigned around editorial typography (Zite + Dieter
  Rams).** The v0.2 report used coloured chips, pills, shadows, and a
  three-column Kanban board to communicate priority and status. v0.3
  removes all of it. Typography does the work that colour did:
  priority is the word `P0` set in small caps in the eyebrow above the
  title, status is the word `Open`, the verdict is a single
  display-type word (`YES` or `NO`). One ink colour for body
  (`#1A1A1A` on `#FAFAF7` paper in light mode; `#ECEAE3` on `#131311`
  in dark mode), one quiet terracotta accent (`#A5391A`) reserved for
  links, CTAs, and the period after `NO`. Hairline rules instead of
  card borders. No shadows. A 640px reading column at every viewport
  width; bug detail pages add a quiet right rail on desktop
  (≥1024px). Mobile gets a sticky `thumb-zone` shelf at the bottom so
  the primary action stays in reach without scrolling back up. Print
  stylesheet drops accent to black and keeps each bug on its own page.
- **Information hierarchy on bug detail pages reordered for the
  engineer-reviewer's sweep:** Eyebrow → Title → Deck → Impact →
  Actual / Expected → Risk to fix → Steps to reproduce → Evidence →
  Notes → Triage log. The eye now lands on what the bug is, then why
  we care, then what's broken — in that order.
- HTML report version marker bumped to
  `<!-- skill:running-bug-review-board v0.3 -->` in `assets.css`,
  `index.html`, `bug.html`, `run.html`.

### Added

- **Two new bug template sections:** `## Impact` and `## Risk to fix`.
  Both are additive — old v0.2 bugs without them render gracefully
  (the corresponding pull-quote and aside simply disappear). Impact
  is filled by the QA agent when filing ("what does a user experience
  if this ships unfixed?") and rendered as a serif pull-quote. Risk
  to fix is usually empty when filed and populated by the engineer
  during the BRB ("local fix, low blast radius" / "cross-cutting,
  spike first"); rendered as a soft tinted aside.
- **Three design samples saved to the skill** for future contributors
  and reviewers:
  `references/templates/html-report/samples/dashboard-desktop.png`,
  `dashboard-mobile.png`, and `bug-detail-desktop.png`. Captured at
  1280×1800, 390×2200, and 1280×2400 respectively against the
  canonical skeletons.
- `references/extending-the-skill.md` version-bump checklist now
  includes the **git tag push** step (regression from v0.2 where the
  manifests said 0.2.0 but the GitHub Releases page kept showing
  0.1.0 until the tag was pushed manually).

### Compatibility

- All v0.3 changes are additive at the data layer (no front-matter
  rows renamed; new sections are optional). Existing v0.2 bug
  markdown renders without modification.
- HTML reports generated by v0.2 use a different version marker; v0.3
  agents that find a v0.2 marker write to `index.next.html` and let
  the user diff before overwriting. The canonical stylesheet should
  be regenerated to pick up the new design tokens.
- `qa-config.json` schema is unchanged. `version: 1` still applies.

### Why

The colour-coded chips and pills of v0.2 drew the eye away from the
prose of each bug. A reviewer scanning ten open issues got pulled into
a colour pattern instead of reading the titles. The traffic-light
palette felt cheap — like a status board, not a magazine of
considered bug reports. v0.3 takes inspiration from
[Zite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zite) (magazine layouts,
editorial typography, restrained colour) and Dieter Rams (less, but
better — unobtrusive chrome, honest hierarchy, no decoration) to put
the prose first and let the engineer make triage decisions on the
text, not the swatch.

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills/releases/tag/v0.3.0

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added

- **Apple-language HTML report.** The QA agent now writes
  `docs/qa/report/index.html` + per-bug and per-run detail pages by
  applying `references/html-report-style-guide.md`. SF Pro typography
  stack, Apple system color palette with default light and dark
  variants, Dynamic Type-style scale (Large Title 34 → Caption 11),
  8-point spacing grid, evidence galleries with embedded screenshots,
  vanilla-JS filter bar, print stylesheet. Canonical CSS + page
  skeletons in `references/templates/html-report/`. Markdown remains
  the source of truth; HTML is regenerated.
- **Issue-tracker integration via `docs/qa/qa-config.json`.** First-
  class adapters for Linear (Linear MCP at `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`)
  and GitHub Issues (`gh`); templated adapters for Jira (REST or
  `jira-cli`) and Notion (Notion MCP). The skill leads with a
  **discovery ceremony** — enumerates signals (`LINEAR_API_KEY`,
  `gh auth status`, Atlassian URL, registered MCP servers, etc.),
  surfaces every finding to the user, and never writes the config
  silently. References: `references/issue-trackers.md`. Helper:
  `scripts/bugs-needing-sync.sh`.
- **Bi-directional sync.** Push (markdown → tracker) at file time or
  BRB time; **pull** (tracker → markdown) at BRB start (`pull.onBRBStart`,
  default ON) and during re-tests (`pull.onReTest`, default ON).
  Reconciliation rules favour the tracker for `fixed` / `verified` and
  the markdown for `open` / `in-progress`; divergences surface as
  user-decision diffs. Bug front-matter gains `Tracker / Linear`,
  `Tracker / GitHub`, `Tracker / Jira`, `Tracker / Notion`, and
  `Tracker / lastSyncedAt` rows. Helper:
  `scripts/bugs-needing-pull.sh`. Tracker-only bugs surfaced to the
  user — never auto-imported (`pull.createLocalForUntracked: "ask"`
  by default).
- **Interactive Bug Review Board workflow.** A separate
  facilitator-agent prompt (`templates/brb-interactive-prompt.md`)
  opens the meeting with the pre-BRB pull, runs pattern-based triage
  heuristics, presents bugs one by one, applies user decisions, syncs
  the tracker, regenerates the HTML, and writes minutes
  (`templates/brb-minutes.md`). Kept intentionally separate from the
  auto pass so triage bias doesn't contaminate discovery. References:
  `references/brb-interactive.md`.
- **Pattern-based triage suggestions.** A catalog of named heuristics
  (`same-suspect-file`, `steps-prefix-overlap`,
  `same-persona-surface-outcome`, `same-console-error`,
  `same-test-id`, `phase-cascade`, `cosmetic-cluster`,
  `regression-marker`, `same-owner`) the agent runs at BRB start (and
  optionally at auto-pass file time). Every suggestion cites the
  heuristic name and the matching text — no embeddings, no LLM API,
  no auto-merge. References: `references/triage-heuristics.md`.
- **New `duplicate` bug status** (BRB-only transition, requires user
  confirmation, records `Duplicate of: BUG-XXX`). Bug template gains
  `Duplicate of` and `Linked bugs (related)` front-matter rows.
- **iOS / iPadOS app testing playbook — curated cite hub.** When the
  repo under QA is an iOS app project (detected via `*.xcodeproj`,
  `Package.swift` with `.iOS`, `Podfile` with `platform :ios`, `ios/`
  directory, etc.), the skill orchestrates and **defers actual
  simulator driving** to the iOS community's purpose-built skills:

  [XcodeBuildMCP](https://github.com/getsentry/XcodeBuildMCP) by
  Cameron Cooke, [App Store Connect CLI](https://github.com/rudrankriyam/App-Store-Connect-CLI)
  + [companion skills](https://github.com/rudrankriyam/app-store-connect-cli-skills)
  by Rudrank Riyam, [ios-simulator-skill](https://github.com/conorluddy/ios-simulator-skill)
  by Conor Luddy, [ios-build-verify](https://github.com/vermont42/ios-build-verify)
  by Josh Adams, [baguette](https://github.com/tddworks/baguette) by
  tddworks, [ios-idb-skill](https://github.com/haowu77/ios-idb-skill)
  by Hao Wu, [serve-sim-skill](https://github.com/malopezr7/serve-sim-skill)
  by malopezr7, [swiftui-autotest-skill](https://github.com/yusufkaran/swiftui-autotest-skill)
  by Yusuf Karan, and [xcode-build-skill](https://github.com/pzep1/xcode-build-skill)
  by pzep1. References: `references/ios-simulator-playbook.md`. The
  iOS playbook is for iOS app projects only, **not** for testing web
  apps on Mobile Safari.
- **Extension story.** New `references/extending-the-skill.md`
  documents how to add a tracker, heuristic, surface, or mode without
  rewriting the skill. `qa-config.json` carries `version: 1` for
  forward-compat; unknown fields are ignored. HTML report carries a
  versioned `<!-- skill:running-bug-review-board v0.2 -->` comment
  marker.

### Changed

- `SKILL.md` rewritten (449 lines, still under the 500-line cap). New
  sections: Two workflows — Auto QA and Interactive BRB; Surfaces —
  which playbook activates; Issue tracker integration; HTML report;
  Pattern-based triage suggestions; Extending this skill. Mode picker,
  Always / Never lists, References, Scripts, and Anti-patterns tables
  updated.
- Scaffolder (`scripts/scaffold-qa.sh`) now writes a stub
  `docs/qa/qa-config.json` (with `issueTracker.type = "none"`) and a
  `docs/qa/report/.gitkeep` so the discovery ceremony and the HTML
  generator have somewhere to write. Printed next-steps hint extended
  to mention the discovery ceremony, the project-type detection, the
  HTML render step, and the separate-session rule for BRB.
- `references/workflow.md` extended: detect project type and issue
  tracker in step 2, run triage heuristics in step 6, generate HTML +
  sync tracker in step 9, schedule interactive BRB as step 11.
- `references/discovering-the-app.md` extended: project-type
  detection table, issue-tracker discovery question template, monorepo
  / mixed-project ask, output checklist now requires project type +
  tracker + heuristic cluster summary.
- `references/bug-filing.md` extended: step 0.5 (check heuristics
  before filing), step 7 (sync to tracker if configured), step 8
  (refresh HTML). Status transitions add `duplicate`. BRB-cadence
  section replaced with a pointer to `brb-interactive.md`.
- `references/browser-playbook.md` clarified: web apps only. The iOS
  Simulator playbook is **not** the right tool for web-app QA.
- `references/sequential-wrapup.md` and
  `references/parallel-coordinator.md` extended to regenerate HTML at
  end of merge and run the sync helpers.
- Bug template and run-report / coordinator-merge templates updated
  with tracker rows, HTML report path, tracker-sync mini-table, and
  generated-artifacts section.

### Compatibility

- All additions are opt-in. v0.1 installs that don't run the discovery
  ceremony, the heuristics, the pull, or the HTML render continue to
  behave exactly as before.
- `qa-config.json` schema is forward-compatible: unknown top-level
  fields are ignored.
- Bug front-matter additions are additive — existing rows keep their
  labels.

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## Pre-0.2.0 history

### Changed

- README install section rewritten with vendor-native install commands per agent: `droid plugin marketplace add` + `droid plugin install` for Factory Droid, `codex plugin marketplace add` + `codex plugin add` (or `/plugins` TUI on Codex 0.125 and earlier) for Codex CLI, and the existing two-line `/plugin marketplace add` flow for Claude Code. Cursor and other agents without a CLI installer are routed to the cross-vendor `npx skills add` from [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills). The manual symlink loop is now a fallback at the end of the section instead of the headline path.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- First Skill file: `running-bug-review-board` — a real-user QA workflow with a Bug Review Board (BRB). Drives the live app like a customer, files structured P0/P1/P2 bug reports, and produces a YES/NO sign-off per phase.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so users can install with two commands: `/plugin marketplace add RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills` followed by `/plugin install running-bug-review-board@rayfernando-skills`.
- Repo restructured to the standard marketplace layout with the plugin under `plugins/running-bug-review-board/`.
- GitHub Actions workflow that builds a claude.ai-compatible zip artifact whenever a `v*` tag is pushed, attached to the GitHub Release.

[0.1.0]: https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills/releases/tag/v0.1.0
