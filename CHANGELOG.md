## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added

- **Apple-language HTML report.** The QA agent now writes
  `docs/qa/report/index.html` + per-bug and per-run detail pages by
  applying `references/html-report-style-guide.md`. SF Pro typography
  stack, Apple system color palette with default light and dark
  variants, Dynamic Type-style scale (Large Title 34 → Caption 11),
  8-point spacing grid, evidence galleries with embedded screenshots,
  vanilla-JS filter bar, print stylesheet. Canonical CSS + page
  skeletons in `references/templates/html-report/`. Markdown remains
  the source of truth; HTML is regenerated.
- **Issue-tracker integration via `docs/qa/qa-config.json`.** First-
  class adapters for Linear (Linear MCP at `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`)
  and GitHub Issues (`gh`); templated adapters for Jira (REST or
  `jira-cli`) and Notion (Notion MCP). The skill leads with a
  **discovery ceremony** — enumerates signals (`LINEAR_API_KEY`,
  `gh auth status`, Atlassian URL, registered MCP servers, etc.),
  surfaces every finding to the user, and never writes the config
  silently. References: `references/issue-trackers.md`. Helper:
  `scripts/bugs-needing-sync.sh`.
- **Bi-directional sync.** Push (markdown → tracker) at file time or
  BRB time; **pull** (tracker → markdown) at BRB start (`pull.onBRBStart`,
  default ON) and during re-tests (`pull.onReTest`, default ON).
  Reconciliation rules favour the tracker for `fixed` / `verified` and
  the markdown for `open` / `in-progress`; divergences surface as
  user-decision diffs. Bug front-matter gains `Tracker / Linear`,
  `Tracker / GitHub`, `Tracker / Jira`, `Tracker / Notion`, and
  `Tracker / lastSyncedAt` rows. Helper:
  `scripts/bugs-needing-pull.sh`. Tracker-only bugs surfaced to the
  user — never auto-imported (`pull.createLocalForUntracked: "ask"`
  by default).
- **Interactive Bug Review Board workflow.** A separate
  facilitator-agent prompt (`templates/brb-interactive-prompt.md`)
  opens the meeting with the pre-BRB pull, runs pattern-based triage
  heuristics, presents bugs one by one, applies user decisions, syncs
  the tracker, regenerates the HTML, and writes minutes
  (`templates/brb-minutes.md`). Kept intentionally separate from the
  auto pass so triage bias doesn't contaminate discovery. References:
  `references/brb-interactive.md`.
- **Pattern-based triage suggestions.** A catalog of named heuristics
  (`same-suspect-file`, `steps-prefix-overlap`,
  `same-persona-surface-outcome`, `same-console-error`,
  `same-test-id`, `phase-cascade`, `cosmetic-cluster`,
  `regression-marker`, `same-owner`) the agent runs at BRB start (and
  optionally at auto-pass file time). Every suggestion cites the
  heuristic name and the matching text — no embeddings, no LLM API,
  no auto-merge. References: `references/triage-heuristics.md`.
- **New `duplicate` bug status** (BRB-only transition, requires user
  confirmation, records `Duplicate of: BUG-XXX`). Bug template gains
  `Duplicate of` and `Linked bugs (related)` front-matter rows.
- **iOS / iPadOS app testing playbook — curated cite hub.** When the
  repo under QA is an iOS app project (detected via `*.xcodeproj`,
  `Package.swift` with `.iOS`, `Podfile` with `platform :ios`, `ios/`
  directory, etc.), the skill orchestrates and **defers actual
  simulator driving** to the iOS community's purpose-built skills:

  tddworks, [ios-idb-skill](https://github.com/haowu77/ios-idb-skill)

  by malopezr7, [swiftui-autotest-skill](https://github.com/yusufkaran/swiftui-autotest-skill)
  by Yusuf Karan, and [xcode-build-skill](https://github.com/pzep1/xcode-build-skill)
  by pzep1. References: `references/ios-simulator-playbook.md`. The
  iOS playbook is for iOS app projects only, **not** for testing web
  apps on Mobile Safari.
- **Extension story.** New `references/extending-the-skill.md`
  documents how to add a tracker, heuristic, surface, or mode without
  rewriting the skill. `qa-config.json` carries `version: 1` for
  forward-compat; unknown fields are ignored. HTML report carries a
  versioned `<!-- skill:running-bug-review-board v0.2 -->` comment
  marker.

### Changed

- `SKILL.md` rewritten (449 lines, still under the 500-line cap). New
  sections: Two workflows — Auto QA and Interactive BRB; Surfaces —
  which playbook activates; Issue tracker integration; HTML report;
  Pattern-based triage suggestions; Extending this skill. Mode picker,
  Always / Never lists, References, Scripts, and Anti-patterns tables
  updated.
- Scaffolder (`scripts/scaffold-qa.sh`) now writes a stub
  `docs/qa/qa-config.json` (with `issueTracker.type = "none"`) and a
  `docs/qa/report/.gitkeep` so the discovery ceremony and the HTML
  generator have somewhere to write. Printed next-steps hint extended
  to mention the discovery ceremony, the project-type detection, the
  HTML render step, and the separate-session rule for BRB.
- `references/workflow.md` extended: detect project type and issue
  tracker in step 2, run triage heuristics in step 6, generate HTML +
  sync tracker in step 9, schedule interactive BRB as step 11.
- `references/discovering-the-app.md` extended: project-type
  detection table, issue-tracker discovery question template, monorepo
  / mixed-project ask, output checklist now requires project type +
  tracker + heuristic cluster summary.
- `references/bug-filing.md` extended: step 0.5 (check heuristics
  before filing), step 7 (sync to tracker if configured), step 8
  (refresh HTML). Status transitions add `duplicate`. BRB-cadence
  section replaced with a pointer to `brb-interactive.md`.
- `references/browser-playbook.md` clarified: web apps only. The iOS
  Simulator playbook is **not** the right tool for web-app QA.
- `references/sequential-wrapup.md` and
  `references/parallel-coordinator.md` extended to regenerate HTML at
  end of merge and run the sync helpers.
- Bug template and run-report / coordinator-merge templates updated
  with tracker rows, HTML report path, tracker-sync mini-table, and
  generated-artifacts section.

### Compatibility

- All additions are opt-in. v0.1 installs that don't run the discovery
  ceremony, the heuristics, the pull, or the HTML render continue to
  behave exactly as before.
- `qa-config.json` schema is forward-compatible: unknown top-level
  fields are ignored.
- Bug front-matter additions are additive — existing rows keep their
  labels.

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## Pre-0.2.0 history

### Changed

- README install section rewritten with vendor-native install commands per agent: `droid plugin marketplace add` + `droid plugin install` for Factory Droid, `codex plugin marketplace add` + `codex plugin add` (or `/plugins` TUI on Codex 0.125 and earlier) for Codex CLI, and the existing two-line `/plugin marketplace add` flow for Claude Code. Cursor and other agents without a CLI installer are routed to the cross-vendor `npx skills add` from [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills). The manual symlink loop is now a fallback at the end of the section instead of the headline path.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- First Skill file: `running-bug-review-board` — a real-user QA workflow with a Bug Review Board (BRB). Drives the live app like a customer, files structured P0/P1/P2 bug reports, and produces a YES/NO sign-off per phase.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so users can install with two commands: `/plugin marketplace add RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills` followed by `/plugin install running-bug-review-board@rayfernando-skills`.
- Repo restructured to the standard marketplace layout with the plugin under `plugins/running-bug-review-board/`.
- GitHub Actions workflow that builds a claude.ai-compatible zip artifact whenever a `v*` tag is pushed, attached to the GitHub Release.
