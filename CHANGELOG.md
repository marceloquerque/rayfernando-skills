# Changelog

All notable changes to this collection are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- README install section rewritten with vendor-native install commands per agent: `droid plugin marketplace add` + `droid plugin install` for Factory Droid, `codex plugin marketplace add` + `codex plugin add` (or `/plugins` TUI on Codex 0.125 and earlier) for Codex CLI, and the existing two-line `/plugin marketplace add` flow for Claude Code. Cursor and other agents without a CLI installer are routed to the cross-vendor `npx skills add` from [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills). The manual symlink loop is now a fallback at the end of the section instead of the headline path.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added

- First Skill file: `running-bug-review-board` — a real-user QA workflow with a Bug Review Board (BRB). Drives the live app like a customer, files structured P0/P1/P2 bug reports, and produces a YES/NO sign-off per phase.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so users can install with two commands: `/plugin marketplace add RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills` followed by `/plugin install running-bug-review-board@rayfernando-skills`.
- Repo restructured to the standard marketplace layout with the plugin under `plugins/running-bug-review-board/`.
- GitHub Actions workflow that builds a claude.ai-compatible zip artifact whenever a `v*` tag is pushed, attached to the GitHub Release.
