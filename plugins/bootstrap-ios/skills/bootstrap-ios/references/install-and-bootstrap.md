# Install And Bootstrap

This reference is for machine setup. Do not use it just because an iOS repo is
present; use it when the user asks to install, bootstrap, or load Ray's iOS
skills.

## Default answer to "do I need an install script?"

For normal agent work, no: this `bootstrap-ios` skill is the main entry point,
and agents should load the referenced skills/rules as needed.

For a new machine or agent environment, yes: run the helper script so the public
community skills and XcodeBuildMCP setup are installed consistently.

## Dry run first

From this skill folder:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap-ios-skills.sh --dry-run --agent cursor
```

Targets:

- `--agent cursor`
- `--agent codex`
- `--agent claude-code`
- `--agent droid`
- omit `--agent` to let `npx skills add` auto-detect where possible

Install globally after confirming:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap-ios-skills.sh --agent cursor
```

The helper passes `--global --yes` to `npx skills add` once you remove
`--dry-run`, so the install is actually one command after the user chooses to
modify the machine.

Include optional setup:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap-ios-skills.sh --agent cursor --include-xcodebuildmcp-init
```

## What the helper installs

Public GitHub-hosted skill folders:

- twostraws SwiftUI Pro
- twostraws Swift Concurrency Pro
- twostraws Swift Testing Pro
- twostraws SwiftData Pro
- AvdLee SwiftUI Expert
- AvdLee Swift Concurrency
- AvdLee Swift Testing Expert
- AvdLee Core Data Expert
- AvdLee Xcode Build Optimization skill pack, discovered with `--full-depth`

The helper points at the concrete skill folders when repos keep `SKILL.md` below
repo root. Do not simplify those URLs back to repo roots unless `npx skills add
--list` proves the installer now discovers them correctly.

It does not install:

- AppCreator, because it is not published as a GitHub skill repo in the article.
- Merowing Swifty Stack course-only rules.
- Official OpenAI plugin paths unless the target agent supports plugin install
  and the current paths are verified.

## After install

Ask the agent to use `bootstrap-ios` before touching Apple-platform code. The
external skills become the focused references; this skill stays the router.
