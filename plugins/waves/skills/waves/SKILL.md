# WAVES — Workers · Aggregate · Verify · Extend (Cursor)

Run **wave-based orchestration** inside one local Cursor session. A **wave** is a
bounded round of isolated agents working in parallel, then a round that verifies
what came back, then a deliberate decision to build on it — not an open-ended
loop. You are the **orchestrator**: you discover, decompose the goal into
independent slices, fan them out to parallel **workers** (the `Task` tool, run in
the background = "Multitask Mode"), read each worker's structured **handoff**,
verify it, and synthesize one deliverable. Workers are isolated and return
exactly one handoff.

**The shape of every wave — WAVE:**

- **W — Workers.** Fan out isolated workers across disjoint slices (the bounded
  parallel round).
- **A — Aggregate.** Wait for all of them and merge their structured handoffs at
  the synthesize barrier.
- **V — Verify.** The moat: check the evidence behind each handoff before you
  trust it.
- **E — Extend.** Decide — deliberately — whether to launch another wave, or stop.

A loop doesn't know when to stop; a wave does, because verification is the stop
function. (Invoked explicitly with `/waves`: a run spawns more agents than usual,
so it's opt-in, not auto-triggered.)

This is the local, zero-setup adaptation of the Cursor team's `orchestrate`
plugin (which spawns *cloud* agents over the Cursor SDK). Same principles —
planners plan, workers hand off up, no cross-talk — without any of that cloud
setup. For heavyweight cloud fan-out, see "Escalating" below.

## When to use

- A large goal that splits into **independent** slices (research areas, data
  chunks, files/modules, audit dimensions).
- The work is mostly **read / research / analysis** — the safest thing to
  parallelize locally (see "Parallel writes" for why).
- A single linear pass would be slow and you want real speedup from concurrency.

## When to skip

- Small or linear tasks (just do them — fan-out overhead isn't worth it).
- Work needing tight back-and-forth or shared mutable state between steps.
- Parallel **edits to the same files** — local workers share one filesystem.

## Core principles

Adapted from `orchestrate`. These keep the run converging without coordination.

1. **Orchestrator plans and synthesizes; it does not do the heavy lifting.**
   Discovering, decomposing, reading handoffs, and writing the final deliverable
   are your job. The bulk reading/research/analysis is delegated to workers.
2. **Workers are isolated.** A subagent has **no access to the user's message,
   your prior steps, or sibling workers.** Every worker prompt must be fully
   self-contained: goal context, its exact slice, where to look, what to return.
3. **One worker, one slice, one handoff.** The worker's final message is the
   only thing you read back. Define its exact shape (see `references/handoff-format.md`).
4. **Parallelism is for reading, not writing.** Local workers share the
   workspace; concurrent writes to overlapping paths corrupt each other.
5. **Continuous motion.** A handoff can reveal new work. Spawn a second wave
   (driven by a handoff gap *or* a new user request). Stop only when every slice
   is terminal and the synthesis is complete.
6. **Verify before you trust.** A worker's `Status: success` is a claim, not
   evidence. Check each handoff against something re-openable before folding it
   into the synthesis. See "Verification" below and `references/verification.md`.

## The loop

Track it with `TodoWrite` so the waves stay visible.

### Step 0 — Discover first (serial, in the main session)

Do **not** fan out blind. Spend a few cheap tool calls in the main session to
learn the shape of the problem: list the directory, read the schema, sample the
data, confirm coverage/size. This is what tells you the *natural* decomposition
(how many chunks, which workstreams). Skipping discovery produces overlapping or
mis-sized slices.

### Step 0.5 — Stage the data (when it's remote or messy)

`explore` workers are **read-only with no MCP or internet access**, so they can't
reach remote hosts, databases, or networked sources. If the source is remote or
wrapped in noise, the orchestrator must stage clean inputs **before** fanning out:

- **Pull remote → local.** SSH/`rsync`/export the relevant data to a local
  scratch dir so read-only workers can read it (e.g. query a remote SQLite
  read-only, export the rows, `rsync` the markdown).
- **Clean + normalize once, centrally.** Strip wrappers, boilerplate, and binary
  blobs (base64, logs); fix timestamps. Doing this once beats making every worker
  re-derive it (and keeps noise out of their context).
- **Pre-chunk for the workers.** Split into the exact per-worker files/ranges so
  each prompt can point at one path.
- **Verify before you spawn.** Print counts and per-slice bounds; confirm the
  partition sums to the total (e.g. 8 chunks × ~388 = 3,097) so no slice is a
  silent blind spot. Fix anomalies (bad sort, dups) centrally, then re-check.
  (Details: `references/verification.md` §1.)

In practice this serial prep is often the *largest* phase; the parallel fan-out is
fast once inputs are clean.

### Step 0.7 — Triage: classify each slice (worker type + verification tier)

Before fanning out, classify each slice on **two axes** — this is the
classify-and-act pattern, routing the right work to the right handler:

- **Worker type** — read-only (`explore`) / web-research (`generalPurpose`) /
  shell / competing-attempt (`best-of-n-runner`) / specialized review (`bugbot`,
  `security-review`). (See the table under "Choosing `subagent_type`".)
- **Verification tier** — how much checking the slice's stakes justify:
  `auto-accept` (low-stakes, corroborated) → `single verifier` (medium) →
  `multi-model panel` (high-stakes) → `debate` (contested, no ground truth).
  Spend the verification budget where a wrong claim is expensive, not uniformly.

### Step 1 — Decompose into independent slices

Split along whichever axis makes slices independent:

- **Data chunks** — partition large data and give each worker a disjoint range
  (e.g. messages 1–500, 501–1000, …).
- **Workstreams** — separate research/analysis areas (e.g. "research voice
  stack", "research the Notion SDK", "audit auth code").
- **Files / modules** — disjoint, non-overlapping path sets.

Each slice needs: a one-line scope, what to look at, and a defined output. For a
big wave (roughly 5+ workers), state the decomposition plan to the user before
spawning so they can redirect cheaply. If you have many slices, fan out in
**waves** (launch a batch, let it complete, launch the next) rather than all at
once, so you stay within practical concurrency limits.

### Step 2 — Fan out in parallel

Send **one message with multiple `Task` tool calls** — that is what makes them
run concurrently. Set `run_in_background: true` on each (Multitask Mode). Pick
`subagent_type` per slice (table below). Give each a 3-5 word `description` and a
self-contained `prompt` ending with the required handoff format.

Then **end your turn.** You are notified as each background worker completes —
do **not** `AwaitShell`, poll, or read output files in a loop. The `Task` call
itself confirms the launch.

### Step 3 — Collect and synthesize

As handoffs arrive, read each one: note `Status`, extract `Key findings`, and
mine `Open questions` / `Suggested follow-ups` — each bullet may become a
second-wave task. Reconcile conflicts across workers.

**Don't trust a handoff because it says `success`.** Verify each finding's
evidence (cited file:line / URL / metric resolves and says what's claimed),
recount headline numbers from the source, and route low-confidence, conflicting,
or citation-heavy claims to a verifier before they enter the draft. See
"Verification" below.

### Step 4 — Second waves (continuous motion)

If handoffs exposed gaps, dependencies, or follow-ups, spawn another parallel
wave the same way. Repeat until no slice is `pending` and nothing new surfaced.

### Step 5 — Deliver

Synthesize all handoffs into the single artifact the user asked for (roadmap,
report, summary, plan). Cite which worker produced which finding when it helps,
and carry each claim's confidence through (`verified / single-sourced /
unverified`) — never launder a `low` into a confident sentence.

Then write any code/files yourself, or spawn a dedicated implementation wave
(mind "Parallel writes"). **Verify the deliverable**, not just the handoffs:
re-run/`curl`/validate served artifacts, regression-check sibling routes, and
re-read the critical files you wrote (see `references/verification.md` §6).

## Bounded waves — size, caps, and when to stop

A wave is bounded on purpose. "Loop-until-done" (spawn until a stop condition) is
a real pattern, but unbounded it burns tokens for little gain: candidate
*generation* is cheap, but *selection* plateaus, and extra rounds are
non-monotonic — more iterations can *lower* quality, not just cost. Bounded waves
keep the exploration and drop the runaway.

- **Width: N = 3–8 workers per wave.** Size N so you can *fully verify all N*. Go
  wider only when a cheap automatic check (tests, schema, exec) gates the results.
- **Depth: ≤ 2–3 waves, capped up front.** Stop when a wave surfaces nothing new
  *and* its outputs are near-duplicates of the last (stagnation), or when quality
  dropped versus the prior wave.
- **Budget: ~60% generation / 40% verification.** Selection is the scarce
  resource; spend there.
- **Match width to difficulty:** easy → 1 + a light refine; medium → 3–5;
  hard/open-ended → 5–8 for approach diversity; hardest/novel → don't loop,
  escalate the model.
- **Anti-poisoning handoff:** carry only a *distilled, verified* handoff (the
  winner + a short critique) into the next wave — never raw transcripts or losing
  candidates. Long, irrelevant context measurably degrades reasoning.

**Loop-until-done is justified only when ALL hold:** a cheap, reliable
~ground-truth verifier exists; the signal is crisp and actionable (a failing
test, not "try harder"); each iteration shows measurable progress; the work is
easy–medium difficulty; and it stays hard-capped. That fits code-with-tests and
exec-feedback pipelines; it misfits open-ended research/writing/design (verify in
bounded waves instead).

## Verification

The orchestrator's highest-leverage job. You can't make a worker smarter at
inference time, but verifying a handoff is far cheaper than producing it, and in a
multi-wave run one unchecked bad handoff compounds into the synthesis.

- **Gate before spawn** — counts, coverage, partition-sums (Step 0.5).
- **Cheap checks every handoff** — evidence present + resolves, scope match,
  contradiction skim, citations actually support the claim.
- **Self-checks in the prompt** — cite-or-drop, confidence tags, "read
  COMPLETELY", live sources, flag-unverified. (Don't rely on freeform
  "double-check yourself"; give an oracle or a separate verifier.)
- **Dedicated verifier worker** for high-stakes / contested / citation-heavy
  claims — give it the claim + sources but **not** the generator's reasoning, and
  have it reason against a rubric/reference before its verdict (reference-guided +
  CoT is the cheapest reliable judge upgrade). Never show the generator the
  verifier's rubric (anti-gaming). For the highest-stakes calls, a multi-model
  panel + synthesis checks harder still (see "Multi-model fan-out").
- **Measure & cross-check** — re-run the oracle, recount from source, require ≥2
  independent sources that actually *entail* the claim (a citation being present
  ≠ the claim being supported).
- **Escalate** low-confidence / conflicting findings (re-task with a tighter
  prompt → dedicated verifier → ask the user, who may choose a stronger model)
  instead of folding them in.

Strongest on objective, checkable work (counts, code, facts-with-sources); on
taste/judgment, verify the sub-claims, don't fake a grade. Keep claims honest:
isolation **reduces error propagation / path dependency**, but don't claim a
quantified "prevents poisoning" — there's no isolation-only ablation. Full
playbook: `references/verification.md`.

## Choosing `subagent_type`

| Slice is… | Use | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Read-only code/data exploration | `explore` | Fast, **read-only**, **no MCP/internet**. Pass thoroughness: "quick" / "medium" / "very thorough". |
| Research needing web / MCP (Exa, Ref, docs) | `generalPurpose` | Multi-step; can use available web/MCP tools. Do **not** set `readonly: true` (that disables MCP/internet). |
| Multi-step work mixing read + light reasoning | `generalPurpose` | The general workhorse. |
| Shell/git heavy investigation | `shell` | Command execution specialist. |
| Browser testing / UI verification | `browser-use` | Navigates and screenshots. **Stateful: auto-resumes one shared instance, so don't fan out `browser-use` in parallel** — use a single serial UI slice. Needs agent mode (not `readonly`). |
| Competing attempts at the same task | `best-of-n-runner` | Each runs in an **isolated git worktree/branch** — safe from shared-checkout clobbering; you then compare attempts and merge the winner. |

Only pass `model` when the user explicitly requests a specific model (and if a
requested model is unavailable, say so rather than silently substituting). The
deliberate exception is a user-requested multi-model panel — see "Multi-model
fan-out" below.

For review/audit slices, Cursor also exposes specialized subagents when available
(e.g. `bugbot`, `security-review`, `ci-investigator`, `ci-watcher`) — prefer them
for those slice types.

## Multi-model fan-out (panel + synthesize)

The default fan-out runs each *slice* on one model. A **high-stakes** slice —
an architecture/design call, a risky correctness question, a security or audit
pass, or a key research synthesis — fan the **same** slice out to a **panel of
different models**, then act as judge and synthesizer.

Reconcile; don't concatenate. Label **CONSENSUS** (2+ models agree) vs
**lone-model** findings, resolve contradictions, dedupe overlap, and carry each
claim's confidence into one answer. The synthesis is where most of the value
lives — per OpenRouter's Fusion research, roughly three-quarters of the gain
comes from the synthesis step, not the model diversity — so invest there rather
than stapling outputs together. Evidence: a panel of independent models + a
judge + a synthesizer matched and surpassed a single top-tier model on hard,
deep-research problems (OpenRouter, *Surpassing Frontier Performance with
Fusion*, openrouter.ai/blog/announcements/fusion-beats-frontier/).

Run it in Cursor: pass a **different `model`** to each sibling `Task` worker on
the same slice, launch them in **one message** with `run_in_background: true`
(parallel), then synthesize. This is the one time the orchestrator picks
models — only when the user asks for a multi-model pass or the slice is
explicitly high-stakes — so **ask which models to use; don't guess slugs.**
That's the deliberate exception to the default rule (otherwise don't set
`model`).

Caveat: a panel multiplies token cost (you pay every worker) and adds latency —
reserve it for high-stakes slices, not routine ones. The adversarial multi-model
review (a panel of reviewer models + one synthesized verdict) is this same
pattern applied to code review.

## Generate-and-filter & tournaments

For open-ended ideation or "produce the single best X", generate several
candidates and **filter** — don't trust one attempt:

- **Cheap filter first.** Gate candidates through a near-ground-truth check
  (tests, schema/exec, dedup/clustering) *before* spending judge tokens —
  generation is cheap, judging is not. (AlphaCode's shape: generate many → filter
  ~99% by tests → cluster → submit a few.)
- **Selection ladder, not all-pairs.** Dedup/cluster → shortlist → pairwise-judge
  only among finalists. A naive O(N²) tournament spends most of its tokens
  comparing also-rans.
- **Use `best-of-n-runner`** for competing *implementation* attempts (each in its
  own git worktree), then inspect/test/merge the winner yourself.
- For high-stakes *judgment* calls, the multi-model panel (above) is the
  generate-and-filter of verification.

## Worker prompt = the contract

A worker cannot ask follow-up questions. Under-specified prompts drift silently.
Write each as if you get one shot. Every worker prompt includes:

1. **Overall goal** (context only — "don't try to own the whole goal").
2. **This worker's exact slice** (the disjoint range / area / paths).
3. **Where to look** (dirs, files, data ranges, which MCP/tools to use).
4. **What to return** — the structured handoff from `references/handoff-format.md`.
5. **Self-verify rules** — cite-or-drop every claim, tag confidence
   (`high|med|low`), and state what you could **not** verify. Analysis workers:
   "read COMPLETELY (N lines) and report the count." Research workers: "use live
   sources, not training data."
6. **Scope boundaries** — what's explicitly OUT of scope (so it doesn't overlap a
   sibling worker).
7. **Return only the handoff.** The worker's entire final message becomes your
   context — tell it to return *only* the structured handoff and to write any
   large artifact to a file and cite the path instead of pasting it inline.
8. **Edit workers: you are not alone.** For implementation slices, warn the
   worker that siblings may be active: own only the listed paths, don't revert
   others' changes, and **never spawn its own subagents** (only the orchestrator
   fans out).

See `references/handoff-format.md` for the copy-paste worker handoff template and
`references/examples.md` for a full worked run (the health-coach research job in
the screenshots) plus reusable decomposition recipes.

## Parallel writes (the local gotcha)

**Local subagents share one working directory.** Concurrent writes to overlapping
files clobber each other.

- Parallel **reads/research/analysis**: always safe. This is the default use.
- **Disjoint edits you keep all of**: use regular workers only when path sets are
  strictly disjoint, or do the edits serially after the research waves finish.
- **Competing attempts at the same task**: use `best-of-n-runner` (each in its
  own git worktree/branch), then **inspect, test, and merge the chosen result
  yourself** — worktrees prevent clobbering, not the merge.

## Escalating to cloud orchestration

For genuinely large builds (many concurrent code-writing agents, runs that
outlive this session, PRs per task), escalate to the Cursor team's `orchestrate`
plugin **if it's installed**. It spawns cloud agents via the Cursor SDK, isolates
each on its own branch, and reconciles handoffs from disk/git. It requires its
own setup (credentials and a runtime, plus optional Slack) — check its docs — and
is invoked explicitly (e.g. `/orchestrate <goal>`).
