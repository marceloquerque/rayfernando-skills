# rayfernando-skills

A collection of installable **Skill files** for AI coding agents. It started with the one most teams are missing — real-user QA — and now also ships `parallel-orchestrate`, an orchestrator-worker skill that fans one big task out to a team of agents (Cursor and Codex variants), plus `bootstrap-ios`, a single entry point for loading Ray's iOS/macOS agent skill stack.

## running-bug-review-board — real-user QA

> **`running-bug-review-board`** — point an AI agent at your *live* app and it QAs it like a real, slightly unforgiving customer: drives the UI, files structured P0/P1/P2 bug reports with reproduction steps, and gives you a **YES/NO** "is this ready to ship?" verdict — plus a self-contained HTML report you can hand to the team.

### What you get

Most AI workflows point at *code review* and miss where users actually hit bugs: the live app, on a real phone, with stale storage from yesterday and a flaky auth provider the unit tests never see. This Skill file encodes a battle-tested QA cadence so an agent can find those bugs for you.

- **A real-user QA pass, not a code review.** The agent drives the app from URLs and clicks — it is *forbidden* from marking anything "pass" by reading source. It hunts the failures users hit first: stale state across flows, mobile overflow, auth↔routing races, copy that lies, paths that 404 mid-onboarding.
- **Structured bug reports.** Every defect lands as `BUG-NNN-*.md` with severity (P0/P1/P2), impact, what-happened-vs-expected, reproduction steps, and evidence (screenshots, console, network).
- **A ship/defer decision.** Each pass ends with a **YES/NO** sign-off for the phase, listing open P0/P1 blockers and a paste-ready handoff prompt for the next agent.
- **An editorial HTML dashboard** stakeholders can open and share — the bug list and each bug report, regenerated every pass. ([see it below](#see-the-output))
- **Works with what you have.** Repo-agnostic and browser-tool-agnostic; web and iOS/iPadOS apps; optional two-way sync with Linear, GitHub Issues, Jira, or Notion. Runs fine in a cloud VM (e.g. Cursor cloud) with just a browser driver.

---

### See the output

The agent regenerates a self-contained HTML report at the end of every pass — designed to read like a magazine, not a Kanban board (editorial typography, ink-on-paper palette, no chips or pills). Here is what you instantly get:

| The QA dashboard | A single bug report |
|---|---|
| [![QA dashboard — verdict, then the prioritized bug list](plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/references/templates/html-report/samples/dashboard-desktop.png)](plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/references/templates/html-report/samples/dashboard-desktop.png) | [![Bug detail — impact, what's happening vs expected, steps, evidence](plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/references/templates/html-report/samples/bug-detail-desktop.png)](plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/references/templates/html-report/samples/bug-detail-desktop.png) |
| **Verdict first, then the prioritized bug list** and recent runs. | **One bug, told for an engineer:** impact → what's happening vs. what should → steps → evidence. |

It is responsive, too — on a phone the dashboard collapses to a single column with a sticky primary action. ([mobile sample](plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/references/templates/html-report/samples/dashboard-mobile.png) · [design notes](plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/references/html-report-style-guide.md))

---

### Example prompts

Once the skill is installed, just ask your agent in plain language:

```text
QA this app. Run a manual test plan on mobile and tell me what's broken.

Is phase 3 ready to ship? Give me a YES/NO with the open P0/P1 list.

Drive the signup flow like a brand-new user with stale storage, and file any bugs you find.

Re-test the fixed bugs BUG-007 and BUG-012 on the latest build and update the report.

Run the Interactive Bug Review Board with me on the open backlog.
```

The skill activates on phrases like *"QA this"*, *"is this ready to ship?"*, *"find the bugs"*, or *"run a test plan"* — you don't have to name it.

---

### Quick start

After [installing](#install), the agent walks itself through:

1. **Discover the app** — read the product spec / README / phase doc, open bugs, and public routes.
2. **Plan** — derive real-user scenarios from the spec and the gates.
3. **Prepare** — environment, test accounts, primary viewport.
4. **Execute** — drive the app like a customer, capturing evidence.
5. **File bugs** — `BUG-NNN-*.md` with priority + reproduction steps.
6. **Sign off** — YES/NO verdict, open P0/P1 list, and a paste-ready handoff.

**No QA folder yet?** The skill ships a scaffolder. After installing it lives in the Skill folder (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/running-bug-review-board/scripts/scaffold-qa.sh`). To run it without installing, clone and call it directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills.git
bash rayfernando-skills/plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/scripts/scaffold-qa.sh \
     /path/to/your/repo PHASE_NUMBER
```

This creates `docs/qa/` with the bug template, run-report skeletons, gates checklist, and a per-phase manual test plan. It is idempotent and won't overwrite existing files.

---

### Install

Pick the section for the agent you use. Each one installs the same Skill file; they differ only in how the agent discovers it.

#### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills
/plugin install running-bug-review-board@rayfernando-skills
```

To pin a specific release tag, append it to the marketplace add (e.g. `@v0.4.0`). Docs: [code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).

#### Factory Droid

```bash
droid plugin marketplace add https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills
droid plugin install running-bug-review-board@rayfernando-skills
```

Factory Droid reads the same `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` Claude Code uses. Docs: [docs.factory.ai/cli/configuration/plugins](https://docs.factory.ai/cli/configuration/plugins).

#### Codex (app, desktop, IDE, and CLI)

On Codex CLI, add the marketplace and install:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills
codex plugin add running-bug-review-board@rayfernando-skills
```

On older Codex CLI without `plugin add`, open Codex, type `/plugins`, switch to the `rayfernando-skills` tab, and Install. In the app/desktop, use the Plugins / Skills installer and restart Codex so the skill cache reloads. Docs: [developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build).

<details>
<summary>Codex shows "invalid description: exceeds maximum length of 1024 characters"?</summary>

You are likely running a cached `running-bug-review-board` 0.3.0 install. Update or reinstall `running-bug-review-board@rayfernando-skills`, then restart Codex (app, desktop, IDE, or CLI) so it refreshes the plugin cache. (0.3.1+ ships Codex-valid metadata and the release pipeline now validates it.)
</details>

#### Cursor

Cursor's `/add-plugin` is reserved for the [cursor.com/marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace) listings, so for this repo use the cross-vendor installer — it writes the Skill folder into `~/.cursor/skills/`, which Cursor reads on startup:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills/tree/main/plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board -a cursor
```

Docs: [cursor.com/docs/skills](https://cursor.com/docs/skills).

#### Cross-vendor: `npx skills add`

The [`vercel-labs/skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) installer detects every supported agent CLI on your machine and writes the Skill folder into each one's expected location (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Factory Droid, Windsurf, Zencoder, and ~50 others):

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills/tree/main/plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board
```

Add `-a <agent>` to target one tool (`-a cursor`, `-a codex`, `-a droid`) or `--all` for every detected agent.

#### claude.ai (Settings → Features → Skills)

Download `running-bug-review-board.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills/releases/latest) and upload it. To build the zip from a local clone (claude.ai expects a zip whose root contains `SKILL.md`):

```bash
cd plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills
zip -r ../../../running-bug-review-board.zip running-bug-review-board
```

#### Manual install (any other agent)

Clone once and symlink the Skill folder into whichever directory your agent reads:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills.git ~/Code/rayfernando-skills
ln -sf ~/Code/rayfernando-skills/plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board \
       ~/.<agent>/skills/running-bug-review-board
```

Replace `~/.<agent>/skills/` with your agent's path (`~/.cursor/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, `~/.factory/skills/`, …). The same symlink can be committed inside a project (e.g. under `.claude/skills/` or `.cursor/skills/`) so anyone who clones it picks up the skill.

---

### How it works

- **Drives the live app.** The agent works through URLs and clicks; marking PASS from code inspection alone is forbidden.
- **Three hats, one pass.** Every pass wears PM (does it still deliver the promise?), QA (run the user scenarios with evidence), and Engineer (catch invalidated assumptions). Finding gaps is the point.
- **BRB cadence.** Bugs live in a versioned folder with status transitions (`open → in-progress → fixed → verified`). P0/P1/P2 tells the team what to ship and what to defer. Triage happens in a separate **Interactive Bug Review Board** session so triage bias never contaminates discovery.
- **Tool- and repo-agnostic.** Adopts whatever conventions exist and scaffolds folders when there are none. Parallel or sequential QA modes.

#### Browser & Computer Use

The agent drives the UI with the best driver your environment has, falling back gracefully — so a pass succeeds whether you're in Cursor, another IDE, or a headless cloud VM:

1. **cursor-ide-browser** MCP (default inside Cursor)
2. **[Chrome DevTools for agents](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp)** (`chrome-devtools-mcp`) — auto-waits for results (fewer flaky races) and adds network / console / Lighthouse / accessibility introspection; can attach to your *real signed-in Chrome* so auth flows don't get bot-flagged
3. **browser-use** MCP / **Playwright**
4. **Codex Computer Use** (macOS) — a human-fidelity pass that sees, clicks, and types in the *real* app, and the only way to reach a native macOS app
5. Manual driving with screenshot/console relay

Details and "drive like a human (don't trip the tests)" recipes live in the [browser playbook](plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/references/browser-playbook.md) and the [Computer Use playbook](plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/references/computer-use-playbook.md). For iOS/iPadOS apps the skill **orchestrates** and defers simulator driving to the [iOS community's purpose-built skills](plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/references/ios-simulator-playbook.md) — and never spins up an iOS simulator for a web-only app.

---

### What's inside

Each Skill file uses **progressive disclosure**: a lean `SKILL.md` entry point, with references loaded only when needed. Auditing the skill (or asking your own agent to security-check it) starts at:

- [`SKILL.md`](plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/SKILL.md) — the entry point: workflow, surfaces, modes, deliverables.
- [`references/`](plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/references/) — the detailed playbooks (discovery, test plan, browser, Computer Use, iOS, trackers, triage, HTML report, extending).
- [`scripts/`](plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/scripts/) — tiny shell helpers (scaffold a QA folder, list bugs needing tracker sync/pull). No magic; the agent does the work.

## parallel-orchestrate — fan out to parallel agents

Turn one big task into a team of agents. `parallel-orchestrate` is an orchestrator-worker skill: the lead agent discovers the shape of the work, splits it into independent slices, fans them out to parallel workers, verifies each structured handoff, and synthesizes one deliverable. It ships in two tool-tuned variants with different prompts:

- **[`parallel-orchestrate`](plugins/parallel-orchestrate/skills/parallel-orchestrate/SKILL.md)** — for **Cursor**, built around the `Task` tool and Multitask Mode (local subagents on a shared filesystem).
- **[`parallel-orchestrate-codex`](plugins/parallel-orchestrate-codex/skills/parallel-orchestrate-codex/SKILL.md)** — for **Codex**, built around Codex subagents, `spawn_agents_on_csv`, `config.toml` limits, and `codex exec` fleets.

Reach for it when a single linear pass would be slow and the work splits into independent slices — big research, analysis, audits, or codebase/data exploration. It activates on phrases like "fan out", "spin up multiple agents", "parallelize this", "analyze all my X and find patterns", "research A/B/C and build a roadmap", or "audit this repo".

**Cursor:**

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills/tree/main/plugins/parallel-orchestrate/skills/parallel-orchestrate -a cursor
```

**Codex:**

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills
codex plugin add parallel-orchestrate-codex@rayfernando-skills
```

**Claude Code:** `/plugin install parallel-orchestrate@rayfernando-skills` (Cursor-tuned) or `/plugin install parallel-orchestrate-codex@rayfernando-skills` (Codex-tuned).

**Cross-vendor (`npx skills add`):** point the installer at either skill folder and pass `-a <agent>` (e.g. `-a codex`, `-a claude-code`, `--all`).

## bootstrap-ios — load the iOS agent stack

`bootstrap-ios` is a meta-skill for Apple-platform app work. It gives agents one
place to start before touching iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Swift, SwiftUI, SwiftData,
Core Data, Swift Testing, Xcode build/test/debug, Simulator, or App Intents.

It does not try to paste every community Swift rule into context. It routes the
agent to the right focused references and tools:

- Paul Hudson / Hacking with Swift skill packs for SwiftUI, concurrency,
  Swift Testing, and SwiftData.
- Antoine van der Lee / SwiftLee skill packs, including Xcode Build
  Optimization.
- Official OpenAI build iOS/macOS plugin references.
- Krzysztof Zablocki's public Merowing rules and rule-loader approach.
- AppCreator buildability ideas.
- XcodeBuildMCP for parseable Xcode build, test, simulator, and debug flows.

**Install the skill:**

```bash
/plugin install bootstrap-ios@rayfernando-skills
```

**Cursor / cross-vendor install:**

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/RayFernando1337/rayfernando-skills/tree/main/plugins/bootstrap-ios/skills/bootstrap-ios -a cursor
```

**Optional one-command helper, after installing or cloning:**

```bash
bash plugins/bootstrap-ios/skills/bootstrap-ios/scripts/bootstrap-ios-skills.sh --dry-run --agent cursor
```

Run without `--dry-run` only when you really want to install the public
community skill packs into that agent environment.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. If you've used the Skill file on a real project, a short writeup of a lesson learned is the most valuable contribution — a session-hygiene rule that saved you, a bug that reveals a new real-user pattern, or a playbook for an auth provider this skill doesn't cover yet. See [`extending-the-skill.md`](plugins/running-bug-review-board/skills/running-bug-review-board/references/extending-the-skill.md) for how the skill grows without rewrites.

Style guide: SKILL.md body under ~500 lines with references one level deep; imperative voice; third-person frontmatter description; examples from real projects; no time-sensitive copy (use "old patterns" sections instead).

## Background

Ray spent 12 years at Apple working across many parts of the system. The lesson he carried away: finding the bugs your users would hit first comes from a repeatable workflow, and he has been refining that cadence on his own projects ever since. The Skill files in this collection are his encoding of that work.
